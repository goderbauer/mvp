# MVP - The Multi View Playground

This repository contains samples to experiment with rendering into multiple views from Flutter. Some samples are
aspirational and may not actually work. Some samples may require a custom engine build to run. Some samples may be
outdated and/or have other issues. DO NOT DEPEND ON ANYTHING IN THIS REPOSITORY.

## How to use?

This sample is meant to be used with a custom (prototype) engine and framework.
Currently, it only supports macOS.

0. Set up the Framework development environment: See [the wiki page](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Setting-up-the-Framework-development-environment).

1. In **the framework repo**, add the prototype remote and switch to the prototype branch:
```
git remote add goderbauer https://github.com/goderbauer/flutter/
git fetch goderbauer
git checkout goderbauer/rawview
```

2. Set up the Engine development environment: See [the wiki page](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Setting-up-the-Engine-development-environment).

3. In **the engine repo**, add the prototype remote and switch to the prototype branch:
```
git remote add loic-sharma https://github.com/loic-sharma/flutter-engine/
git fetch loic-sharma
git checkout loic-sharma/multiview-prototype
```

4. In **this repo**, edit `pubspec.yaml`, and add the following dependency override to use the custom `dart:ui` library:
```
dependency_overrides:
  sky_engine:
    path: /path/to/flutter/engine/out/host_debug_unopt/gen/dart-pkg/sky_engine
```

5. Build the custom engine: See [the wiki page](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Compiling-the-engine#compiling-for-macos-or-linux).

6. In **this repo**, update packages.
```
flutter pub get
```

7. Run a sample file (see below for options) with the custom engine. For example,
```
flutter run --local-engine=host_debug_unopt -d macos -t lib/raw_dynamic.dart
```

8. If everything goes well, the app should start up with a window, then another window after 1 second.

## Samples

### raw_static.dart

Renders some view-specific information into each `FlutterView` available in `PlatformDispatcher.views` using only APIs
exposed by `dart:ui`. A new frame is only scheduled if the metrics of a `FlutterView` change or if a view is
added/removed.

### raw_dynamic.dart

Renders a spinning rectangular into each `FlutterView` available in `PlatformDispatcher.views` using only APIs exposed
by `dart:ui`. Frames are continuously scheduled to keep the animation running.

### widgets_static.dart

Renders some view-specific information into each `FlutterView` available in `PlatformDispatcher.views` using the Flutter
widget framework (`package:flutter/widgets.dart`). A new frame is only scheduled if the metrics of a `FlutterView`
change or if a view is added/removed.

### widgets_dynamic.dart

Renders a spinning rectangular into each `FlutterView` available in `PlatformDispatcher.views` using the Flutter
widget framework (`package:flutter/widgets.dart`). Frames are continuously scheduled to keep the animation running.

### widgets_counter.dart

Renders the Counter app (an interactive Material Design app) into each `FlutterView` available in
`PlatformDispatcher.views`.
